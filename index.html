         <h1>5 Vague and Mildly-spoiled Reviews of Horror Movies Released in 2022</h1>
         
         <img src = "/images/Nope.jpg" alt = "Still from Nope" style="width:800px;height:450px;">
         <h2  style="text-align:right;">Nope</h2>
            <p>Jordan Peele's latest feature film Nope arrived with enormous anticipation back in July. As was expected due to the trailers, the main threat of the movie came in the form of aliens. Or rather, I should say an alien-- and maybe it's not really an alien, at least in terms of being otherworldly. Also, there's a murderous chimpanzee. The more I think about it, perhaps the big bad in this movie is the film industry, or culture industries in general.</p>
            <p>My overall takeaway on this movie is that, after the reveal of the supernatural creature, it largely turns into an adventure film. In the last act, while there is tension, it doesn't evoke fear. All unknowns have been filled in; the objective is obvious; it's just a matter of execution. All said and done, it's a fun movie, but it's not great horror.</p>

         <h2>Bodies Bodies Bodies</h2>
            <p>While the threat of Bodies Bodies Bodies is far more conventional than that of Nope, my presiding judgment is the same: fun, not scary. But it absolutely is fun! A Gen-Z group (plus a bonus Lee Pace) is stuck together in a mansion waiting out a hurricane. After a dead body is found, the group begins to question who among them is a murderer. Unlike Nope, Bodies Bodies Bodies starts with and maintains that air of mystery throughout, up until the very end. The final reveal made my day.</p>
            <p>Regardless, it's more whodunit than horror.</p>
         
      <img src = "/images/Prey.jpg" alt = "Still from Prey" style="width:800px;height:450px;">
         <h2>Prey</h2>
            <p>The prequel to Predator released directly to streaming. Prey had a fair amount of hype, especially related to its portrayal of a Comanche tribe. The writers knew that, going into this, audiences would have a good grasp of the antagonist, and as a result, they do not bother with much time spent establishing the nature of the Predator. While this makes sense, it robs the movie of potential scares, especially in the first two acts.</p>
            <p>Like the previous reviews, I will echo the same sentiment here: there is not much horror. There is tension due to the threats facing the main character, but it does not escalate beyond tension to horror.</p>

      <img src = "/images/Barbarian.jpg" alt = "Still from Barbarian" style="width:800px;height:450px;">
         <h2>Barbarian</h2>
            <p>Finally a movie that I would genuinely classify as horror! Written and directed by Zach Cregger (of Whitest Kids U'Know fame), Barbarian centers on a house in the outskirts of Detroit. Initially following a woman that books the house on Barbary St. through AirBnB, the movie enumerates multiple social and physical threats. Someone else is staying in the house, booked through a different platform, and she's in a bad neighborhood. From there, the mysteries begin to compound.</p>
            <p>Perhaps most controversially, the film uses a hard cut to follow a different character halfway through. The tonal shift is jarring, but it highlights Cregger's aptitude for comedy. By the end, however, we enter a fully realized horror scenario. There are visceral scares here; it is unpleasant and disgusting, and it stays with you well after the film's conclusion.</p>
      
      <img src = "/images/Deadstream.jpg" alt = "Still from Deadstream" style="width:800px;height:450px;">      
         <h2>Deadstream</h2>
            <p>Tucked away on the horror-only streaming service Shudder, Deadstream premiered back in March 2022. Audiences watch as a livestreamer enters a haunted mansion with the premise that he films himself confronting his fears. Through various asides, we come to learn that the streamer is trying to redeem himself after having been canceled due to an on-stream incident in which he seriously hurt an unhoused person.</p>
            <p>It is not long before we begin to see ghostly activity. I greatly appreciate that the film does not go down the route of having the paranormal activity be staged by the streamer; they represent genuine antagonists. The special effect work is clearly budget, but it is effective. Some find the main character to be obnoxious, but that would be par for the course when it comes to livestreamers. The story maintains the mystery almost to the end. This movie alone is easily worth the $5/month charged by Shudder.</p>
